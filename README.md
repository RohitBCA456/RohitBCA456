## 🧠 About Me
I’m a **backend-first developer** focused on building **real, usable systems**, not demos.

I work deeply with **Node.js backends**, design clean APIs, connect them with **React & React Native frontends**, and experiment with **LLMs** where they actually add value.

I prefer **deterministic systems**, predictable behavior, and code that scales cleanly.
